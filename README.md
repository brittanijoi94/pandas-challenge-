Three observable trends based on the Heroes of Pymoli data set:

- Coming in at 84% males were the most popular players with females only coming in at 14%.

- Players ranging in age 20-24 make up the most percentage of players at 44% and the lowest age group was 40+ at 2% of players. 

- The most profitable item was Final critic with the purchase count of 13 and sells for $4.61 per item.

The trends show that the players that dominate in this data set are males ranging in age from 20-24. So when marketing comes into play, they should try to appeal to this population since they are the ones most active with purchasing and playing.
